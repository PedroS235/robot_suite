## Services

The `tello_msgs` package also includes services for controlling the drone. These services will be documented in detail as they are implemented.

---

## Usage

This package is essential for ROS2 nodes interacting with the Tello drone. It defines all necessary message and service formats for controlling the drone and processing its telemetry.

For more information, refer to the [Tello Driver documentation](#tello-driver).
