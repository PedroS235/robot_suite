# ⚙️ Install

## Prerequisites

- ROS2 Humble or later (only tested with Humble)
- Ubuntu 22.04

## Dependencies

- `tellopy` (must be installed from source)
- `av`
- `pillow`
- `py-trees`
- `pygame`
- `mediapipe`

To simplify the setup, we provide a `bootstrap.sh` script that installs all dependencies. Run the following command:

```sh
./bootstrap.sh

Alternatively, if you prefer manual installation, ensure each of the dependencies above is installed.
